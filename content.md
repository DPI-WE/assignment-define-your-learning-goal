# Assignment: Define Your Learning Goal

## 1. Select a Skill/Certification Focus

Identify a specific technology, job description, tool, or certification path (e.g., cybersecurity, quality assurance, IT support, software engineering, etc.) that aligns with your career interests.

Make sure this skill is both relevant to your career goals and realistically achievable within the next few months.

## 2. State Your “Why”

Explain the primary motivation behind choosing this skill or certification.
Consider how it will support your professional development, enhance your employability, or solve a particular problem you’re passionate about.

## 3. Outline Your Learning Path

Describe how you plan to learn: list the resources (online tutorials, practice projects, books, official training materials) you’ll use.

Consider any potential mentors, study groups, or practice environments you might leverage for hands-on experience.

## 4. Set Measurable Milestones

Break your goal into smaller, actionable steps (e.g., courses to complete, practice exercises to finish, practices exams to take, certifications, etc.).

Assign a rough timeline or due date for each milestone, keeping in mind realistic pacing and personal commitments.

## 5. Draft Your Success Criteria

Define clear metrics that indicate you’ve successfully acquired the skill or passed the certification exam (e.g., course completion certificates, practice test scores, applied projects).

Think about how you will know when you’re “job-ready” in this niche.

## 6. Reflection & Next Steps

Reflect on potential obstacles (time, access to resources, motivation) and how you will address them.

Identify at least one immediate next step to get started.

## Submission Guidelines

Write a short, clear document (1–2 pages) outlining each of the steps above. This will be a "living document" that you will update as you reach milestones and adjust as you learn more.

This can be written in a [Google Doc](https://workspace.google.com/products/docs/) (anyone with link can comment), [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/), or other similar platform.

Please write your "Learning Goal" document and share your url.
